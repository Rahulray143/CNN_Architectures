# CNN_Architectures
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python to classify diseases from medical images.
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to classify diseases from medical images. It simulates a basic image classification task using synthetic image data representing two disease classes. The CNN model consists of convolutional and pooling layers that extract features from the images, followed by dense layers that perform the classification. The model is trained on a set of randomly generated images and then evaluated for accuracy. Although synthetic data is used here for demonstration, the architecture can be directly applied to real medical image datasets for disease detection tasks.
